## open_dir_platform_interface

Platform interface for open_dir plugin

### Note on breaking changes
Strongly prefer non-breaking changes (such as adding a method to the interface) over breaking changes for this package.

See https://flutter.dev/go/platform-interface-breaking-changes for a discussion on why a less-clean interface is preferable to a breaking change.
